**Event Generator**

You need Python installed for this to work. Preferably Python 3.9 and above.
To check if you have it installed, open a CMD and type "python". It should output the current version if installed.

**To use :**
Configure the data.json file to your needs by using the example.txt file as a guide.
Run the run.bat file. You will get warnings in case you made a mistake somewhere.
